    "abstract": "The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.",

Since 2018 alone, we have seen the emergence of BERT and its variants [39, 70, 74, 113, 146], GPT-2 [106], T-NLG [112], GPT-3 [25], and most recently Switch-C [43], with institutions seemingly competing to produce ever larger LMs. While investigating properties of LMs and how they change with size holds scientific interest, and large LMs have shown improvements on various tasks (§2), we ask whether enough thought has been put into the potential risks associated with developing them and strategies to mitigate these risks."

Echoing a line of recent work outlining the environmental and financial costs of deep learning systems [129], we encourage the research community to prioritize these impacts. One way this can be done is by reporting costs and evaluating works based on the amount of resources they consume [57]. As we outline in §3, increasing the environmental and financial costs of these models doubly punishes marginalized communities that are least likely to benefit from the progress achieved by large LMs and most likely to be harmed by negative environmental consequences of its resource consumption. At the scale we are discussing (outlined in §2), the first consideration should be the environmental cost."

In §4, we discuss how large datasets based on texts from the Internet overrepresent hegemonic viewpoints and encode biases potentially damaging to marginalized populations. In collecting ever larger datasets we risk incurring documentation debt. We recommend mitigating these risks by budgeting for curation and documentation at the start of a project and only creating datasets as large as can be sufficiently documented."

This not only helps reduce hype which can mislead the public and researchers themselves regarding the capabilities of these LMs, but might encourage new research directions that do not necessarily depend on having larger LMs. As we discuss in §5, LMs are not performing natural language understanding (NLU), and only have success in tasks that can be approached by manipulating linguistic form [14]. Focusing on state-of-the-art results on leaderboards without encouraging deeper understanding of the mechanism by which they are achieved can cause misleading results as shown in [21, 93] and direct resources away from efforts that would facilitate long-term progress towards natural language understanding, without using unfathomable training data."

Combined with the ability of LMs to pick up on both subtle biases and overtly abusive language patterns in training data, this leads to risks of harms, including encountering derogatory language and experiencing discrimination at the hands of others who reproduce racist, sexist, ableist, extremist or other harmful ideologies reinforced through interactions with synthetic language. We explore these potential harms in §6 and potential paths forward in §7."

Such systems are unsupervised and when deployed, take a text as input, commonly outputting scores or string predictions. Initially proposed by Shannon in 1949 [117], some of the earliest implemented LMs date to the early 1980s and were used as components in systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), document classification, and more [111]. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the general trend of language modeling in recent years. For a more in-depth survey of pretrained LMs, see [105]."

In addition to ASR, these large n-gram models of English were developed in the context of machine translation from another source language with far fewer direct translation examples. For example, [20] developed an n-gram model for English with a total of 1.8T n-grams and noted steady improvements in BLEU score on the test set of 1797 Arabic translations as the training data was increased from 13M tokens."

These word vectors came from systems such as word2vec [85] and GloVe [98] and later LSTM models such as context2vec [82] and ELMo [99] and supported state of the art performance on question answering, textual entailment, semantic role labeling (SRL), coreference resolution, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis, at first in English and later for other languages as well. While training the word embeddings required a (relatively) large amount of data, it reduced the amount of labeled data necessary for training on the various supervised tasks. For example, [99] showed that a model trained with ELMo reduced the necessary amount of training data needed to achieve similar results on SRL compared to models without, as shown in one instance where a model trained with ELMo reached the maximum development F1 score in 10 epochs as opposed to 486 without ELMo. This model furthermore achieved the same F1 score with 1% of the data as the baseline model achieved with 10% of the training data. Increasing the number of model parameters, however, did not yield noticeable increases for LSTMs [e.g. 82]."

[39] in particular noted that training on a large dataset and fine-tuning for specific tasks leads to strictly increasing results on the GLUE tasks [138] for English as the hyperparameters of the model were increased. Initially developed as Chinese LMs, the ERNIE family [130, 131, 145] produced ERNIE-Gen, which was also trained on the original (English) BERT dataset, joining the ranks of very large LMs. NVIDIA released the MegatronLM which has 8.3B parameters and was trained on 174GB of text from the English Wikipedia, OpenWebText, RealNews and CC-Stories datasets [122]. Trained on the same dataset, Microsoft released T-NLG[^1], an LM with 17B parameters. OpenAI's GPT-3 [25] and Google's GShard [73] and Switch-C [43] have increased the definition of large LM by orders of magnitude in terms of parameters at 175B, 600B, and 1.6T parameters, respectively. Table 1 summarizes a selection of these LMs in terms of training data size and parameters. As increasingly large amounts of text are collected from the web in datasets such as the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus [107] and the Pile [51], this trend of increasingly large LMs can be expected to continue as long as they correlate with an increase in performance.",

Wu and Drezde [144] found that while mBERT does not perform equally well across all 104 languages in its training data, it performed better at NER, POS tagging, and dependency parsing than monolingual models trained with comparable amounts of data for four low-resource languages. Conversely, [95] surveyed monolingual BERT models developed with more specific architecture considerations or additional monolingual data and found that they generally outperform mBERT across 29 tasks. Either way, these models do not address the inclusion problems raised by [65], who note that over 90% of the world's languages used by more than a billion people currently have little to no support in terms of language technology."

Rogers et al. [110] provide a comprehensive comparison of models derived from BERT using these techniques, such as DistilBERT [113] and ALBERT [70]. While these models maintain and sometimes exceed the performance of the original BERT model, despite their much smaller size, they ultimately still rely on large quantities of data and significant processing and storage capabilities to both hold and reduce the model."

Nonetheless, all of these systems share the property of being LMs in the sense we give above, that is, systems trained to predict sequences of words (or characters or sentences). Where they differ is in the size of the training datasets they leverage and the spheres of influence they can possibly affect. By scaling up in these two ways, modern very large LMs incur new kinds of risk, which we turn to in the following sections."

As shown in [5], the amount of compute used to train the largest deep learning models (for NLP and other applications) has increased 300,000x in 6 years, increasing at a far higher pace than Moore's Law. To promote green AI, Schwartz et al. argue for promoting efficiency as an evaluation metric and show that most sampled papers from ACL 2018, NeurIPS 2018, and CVPR 2019 claim accuracy improvements alone as primary contributions to the field, and none focused on measures of efficiency as primary contributions. Since then, works such as [57, 75] have released online tools to help researchers benchmark their energy usage. Among their recommendations are to run experiments in carbon friendly regions, consistently report energy and carbon metrics, and consider energy-performance trade-offs before deploying energy hungry models. In addition to these calls for documentation and technical fixes, Bietti and Vatanparast underscore the need for social and political engagement in shaping a future where data driven systems have minimal negative impact on the environment [16].",

While this was reportedly effective at filtering out documents that previous work characterized as \"unintelligible\" [134], what is unmeasured (and thus unknown) is what else it filtered out. The Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus [107], used to train a trillion parameter LM in [43], is cleaned, inter alia, by discarding any page containing one of a list of about 400 \"Dirty, Naughty, Obscene or Otherwise Bad Words\" [p.6].[^14] This list is overwhelmingly words related to sex, with a handful of racial slurs and words related to white supremacy (e.g. swastika, white power) included. While possibly effective at removing documents containing pornography (and the associated problematic stereotypes encoded in the language of such sites [125]) and certain kinds of hate speech, this approach will also undoubtedly attenuate, by suppressing such words as twink, the influence of online spaces built by and for LGBTQ people.[^15] If we filter out the discourse of marginalized populations, we fail to provide training data that reclaims slurs and otherwise describes marginalized identities in a positive light.",

These conversations challenge behaviors that have been historically considered appropriate or even the fault of women, shifting notions of sexually inappropriate behavior. Any product development that involves operationalizing definitions around such shifting topics into algorithms is necessarily political (whether or not developers choose the path of maintaining the status quo ante). For example, men and women make significantly different assessments of sexual harassment online [40]. An algorithmic definition of what constitutes inappropriately sexual communication will inherently be concordant with some views and discordant with others. Thus, an attempt to measure the appropriateness of text generated by LMs, or the biases encoded by a system, always needs to be done in relation to particular social contexts and marginalized perspectives [19]."

The fact that human-human communication is a jointly constructed activity [29, 128] is most clearly true in co-situated spoken or signed communication, but we use the same facilities for producing language that is intended for audiences not co-present with us (readers, listeners, watchers at a distance in time or space) and in interpreting such language when we encounter it.

While some of the most overtly derogatory words could be filtered out, not all forms of online abuse are easily detectable using such taboo words, as evidenced by the growing body of research on online abuse detection [45, 109]. Furthermore, in addition to abusive language [139] and hate speech [67], there are subtler forms of negativity such as gender bias [137], microaggressions [22], dehumanization [83], and various socio-political framing biases [44, 114] that are prevalent in language data. For example, describing a woman's account of her experience of sexism with the word tantrum both reflects a worldview where the sexist actions are normative and foregrounds a stereotype of women as childish and not in control of their emotions."

If such an LM produces text that is put into the world for people to interpret (flagged as produced by an 'AI' or otherwise), what risks follow? In the first instance, we foresee that LMs producing text will reproduce and even amplify the biases in their input [53]. Thus the risk is that people disseminate text generated by LMs, meaning more text in the world that reinforces and propagates stereotypes and problematic associations, both to humans who encounter the text and to future LMs trained on training sets that ingested the previous generation LM's output. Humans who encounter this text may themselves be subjects of those stereotypes and associations or not. Either way, harms ensue: readers subject to the stereotypes may experience the psychological harms of microaggressions [88, 141] and stereotype threat [97, 126]. Other readers may be introduced to stereotypes or have ones they already carry reinforced, leading them to engage in discrimination (consciously or not) [55], which in turn leads to harms of subjugation, denigration, belittlement, loss of opportunity [3, 4, 56] and others on the part of those discriminated against."

The harms that could follow from these risks are again similar to those identified above for more subtly biased language, but perhaps more acute to the extent that the language in question is overtly violent or defamatory. They include the psychological harm experienced by those who identify with the categories being denigrated if they encounter the text; the reinforcement of sexist, racist, ableist, etc. ideology; follow-on effects of such reinforced ideologies (including violence); and harms to the reputation of any individual or organization perceived to be the source of the text."

Similarly, biases in an LM used in query expansion could influence search results, further exacerbating the risk of harms of the type documented by Noble in [94], where the juxtaposition of search queries and search results, when connected by negative stereotypes, reinforce those stereotypes and cause psychological harm."

These include prosaic cases, such as services set up to 'automatically' write term papers or interact on social media,[^23] as well as use cases connected to promoting extremism. For example, McGuffie and Newhouse [80] show how GPT-3 could be used to generate text in the persona of a conspiracy theorist, which in turn could be used to populate extremist recruitment message boards. This would give such groups a cheap way to boost recruitment by making human targets feel like they were among many like-minded people. If the LMs are deployed in this way to recruit more people to extremist causes, then harms, in the first instance, befall the people so recruited and (likely more severely) to others as a result of violence carried out by the extremists.",

This differs somewhat from the cases above in that there was an initial human communicative intent, by the author of the source language text. However, MT systems can (and frequently do) produce output that is inaccurate yet both fluent and (again, seemingly) coherent in its own right to a consumer who either doesn't see the source text or cannot understand the source text on their own. When such consumers therefore mistake the meaning attributed to the MT output as the actual communicative intent of the original text's author, real-world harm can ensue. A case in point is the story of a Palestinian man, arrested by Israeli police, after MT translated his Facebook post which said \"good morning\" (in Arabic) to \"hurt them\" (in English) and \"attack them\" (in Hebrew).[^24] This case involves a short phrase, but it is easy to imagine how the ability of large LMs to produce seemingly coherent text over larger passages could erase cues that might tip users off to translation errors in longer passages as well [77].",

For example, [28] demonstrate a methodology for extracting personally identifiable information (PII) from an LM and find that larger LMs are more susceptible to this style of attack than smaller ones. Building training data out of publicly available documents doesn't fully mitigate this risk: just because the PII was already available in the open on the Internet doesn't mean there isn't additional harm in collecting it and providing another avenue to its discovery. This type of risk differs from those noted above because it doesn't hinge on seeming coherence of synthetic text, but the possibility of a sufficiently motivated user gaining access to training data via the LM. In a similar vein, users might query LMs for 'dangerous knowledge' (e.g. tax avoidance advice), knowing that what they were getting was synthetic and therefore not credible but nonetheless representing clues to what is in the training data in order to refine their own search queries."

We note that the risks associated with synthetic but seemingly coherent text are deeply connected to the fact that such synthetic text can enter into conversations without any person or entity being accountable for it.

We should consider our research time and effort a valuable resource, to be spent to the extent possible on research projects that build towards a technological ecosystem whose benefits are at least evenly distributed or better accrue to those historically most marginalized. This means considering how research contributions shape the overall direction of the field and keeping alert to directions that limit access. Likewise, it means considering the financial and environmental costs of model development up front, before deciding on a course of investigation. The resources needed to train and tune state-of-the-art models stand to increase economic inequities unless researchers incorporate energy and compute efficiency in their model evaluations. Furthermore, the goals of energy and compute efficient model building and of creating datasets and models where the incorporated biases can be understood both point to careful curation of data. Significant time should be spent on assembling datasets suited for the tasks at hand rather than ingesting massive amounts of data from convenient or easily-scraped Internet sources. As discussed in §4.1, simply turning to massive dataset size as a strategy for being inclusive of diverse viewpoints is doomed to failure. We recall again Birhane and Prabhu's [18] words (inspired by Ruha Benjamin [15]): \"Feeding AI systems on the world's beauty, ugliness, and cruelty, but expecting it to reflect only the beauty is a fantasy.\""

This documentation should reflect and indicate researchers' goals, values, and motivations in assembling data and creating a given model. It should also make note of potential users and stakeholders, particularly those that stand to be negatively impacted by model errors or misuse. We note that just because a model might have many different applications doesn't mean that its developers don't need to consider stakeholders.

To that end, LM development may benefit from guided evaluation exercises such as pre-mortems [68]. Frequently used in business settings before the deployment of new products or projects, pre-mortem analyses center hypothetical failures and ask team members to reverse engineer previously unanticipated causes.[^25] Critically, pre-mortem analyses prompt team members to consider not only a range of potential known and unknown project risks, but also alternatives to current project plans. In this way, researchers can consider the risks and limitations of their LMs in a guided way while also considering fixes to current designs or alternative methods of achieving a task-oriented goal in relation to specific pitfalls.",

These approaches help surface not only stakeholder values, but also values expressed by systems and enacted through interactions between systems and society [120]. For researchers working with LMs, value sensitive design is poised to help throughout the development process in identifying whose values are expressed and supported through a technology and, subsequently, how a lack of support might result in harm."

If, as we advocate, the field backs off from the path of ever larger LMs, are we thus sacrificing benefits that would accrue to these populations? As a case in point, consider automatic speech recognition, which has seen some improvements thanks to advances in LMs, including both in size and in architecture [e.g. 8, 59, 121], though the largest LMs typically are too large and too slow for the near real-time needs of ASR systems [60]. Improved ASR has many beneficial applications, including automatic captioning which has the potential to be beneficial for Deaf and hard of hearing people, providing access to otherwise inaccessible audio content.[^26] We see two beneficial paths forward here: The first is a broader search for means of improving ASR systems, as indeed is underway, since the contexts of application of the technology aren't conducive to using ever larger LMs [60]. But even if larger LMs could be used, just because we've seen that large LMs can help doesn't mean that this is the only effective path to stronger ASR technology. (And we note that if we want to build strong ASR technology across most of the world's languages, we can't rely on having terabytes of data in all cases.) The second, should we determine that large LMs are critical (when available), is to recognize this as an instance of a dual use problem and consider how to mitigate the harms of LMs used as stochastic parrots while still preserving them for use in ASR systems. Could LMs be built in such a way that synthetic text generated with them would be watermarked and thus detectable [7, 66, 123]? Are there policy approaches that could effectively regulate their use?",

Work on synthetic human behavior is a bright line in ethical AI development, where downstream effects need to be understood and modeled in order to block foreseeable harm to society and different social groups. Thus what is also needed is scholarship on the benefits, harms, and risks of mimicking humans and thoughtful design of target tasks grounded in use cases sufficiently concrete to allow collaborative design with affected communities."
