However, we rarely consider how these incredible technologies were created and who contributed to their development. Behind these sophisticated applications lies the hard work and dedication of countless data workers, who are often unrecognized. These individuals, whom I call the \"hidden soldiers\" of the Artificial Intelligence revolution, play a crucial yet overlooked role in the AI industry."

            "text": "Developing and maintaining artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models requires more than just engineers, scientists, and data analysts â€“ data annotators are important, too. They are responsible for accurately labeling and classifying data, an essential task for training algorithms. They assign labels to the data and ensure that these labels are accurate and consistent. Data annotators may work with images, text, audio, or video, drawing bounding boxes around objects in images, transcribing speech, or tagging entities in text. Their tasks also include reviewing and validating annotations to maintain high data quality, following specific guidelines, and using various annotation tools to facilitate their work. As the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning expands across industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, the demand for skilled data annotators continues to rise. While automation can assist and streamline some aspects of data annotation, human input remains crucial to ensure the accuracy, quality, and contextual understanding needed for effective AI and machine learning models."

These data workers confront significant psychological and economic obstacles that prevent them from achieving financial stability. My experiences as a refugee in Lebanon, combined with my role as a supervisor and lead of an annotation team of 10 members (all of them graduates in Lebanon), provide valuable insights into the struggles of this community. Through direct engagement with the data labeling team and a series of interviews with them, I delve into the psychological impact of their work, their satisfaction with compensation, barriers to achieving work-life balance, and potential support from recruitment agencies. By participating in the Data Workers' Inquiry Project as a co-researcher, I hope I can amplify the voices of data workers, especially the data annotators, and ensure that their experiences resonate internationally. It is important to highlight how this marginalized group is restricted by Lebanon's strict labor laws and the limited availability of annotation projects and to capture their diverse perspectives and experiences to enrich our understanding of them and the industry. The focus on the psychological impact of this work and its relationship to wage satisfaction is closely related to my own experience. The lack of available job opportunities and reliance on a single source of income creates a climate of psychological stress and despair, which negatively affects well-being. By focusing on these issues, I aim to advocate for meaningful changes and better support for data workers in general and Syrian refugees in particular."

It was a strange field and the first time we heard about it -none of us had imagined that we would work in it before. We were very happy with this opportunity. Finally, there was a field in which we could work, show our skills, and feel our importance. I still remember my feeling when we worked on the first paid project. I felt that I had returned to life. The girl who holds a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory technology and is pursuing a master's degree in public health is no longer just a housewife, but she works remotely and earns an income, albeit a modest one. This was a very happy change for all of us."

During a project, I cannot tolerate excuses and expect complete dedication from all participants. Though I may seem strict, my actions are driven by the collective goal of project success, which ultimately means team success.

In the cleaning projects, it seems that we exclude unwanted images with a 'click of a button,' but it actually requires a lot of attention and focus.

One annotator asked,\"why do we have to show flexibility and re-implement the work eventhough it is not our fault, as the instructions were not clear from the beginning? Would it not be better for us to work in direct communication with the client to understand their needs? Is it fair to work twice on a project for one wage? We were compelled to depart our homeland and must confront the unjust regulations in Lebanon that obstructed our pursuit of careers.

This financial exclusion exacerbates the economic difficulties they face and perpetuates their marginalized position. To confront this injustice, some workers resort to using the accounts of trusted friends or family members outside Lebanon. However, this method does not always succeed. One annotator shared his experience, saying: \"I opened an account on the Appen platform, and for financial transfers, it requires a Pioneer account, so I put the financial account of a friend of mine in Iraq: I received an audio transcription project, which paid an excellent allowance of two dollars for each audio recording, although its duration did not exceed 15 seconds. In the end, I could not get the money because the financial account must match the person who created the account. My friend created an account in his name to match his financial account and redid the work on the tasks I had finished and only this way I was able to get the money that arrived in his account and send it to me via Western Union.\" Our financial compensation from HITLis processed through an intermediary organization in Lebanon which partners with HITL. The organization handles financial transfers and distributes the money to us via telegraphic transfer. We receive the money from the bank that is associated with this organization. Since a valid residence permit is not required to receive the money, the process is convenient, but it can take some time. We sometimes do not receive our work allowances until after two months."
